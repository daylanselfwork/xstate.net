title: State Machine

Invoking another state machine as a service gives you a lot of power to build complex and complicated systems without writing too much code in one class.

State machine invocation is implemented with the same semantics as `async` services. Once executing state machine is done, the parent state machine moved to the next state by ID given in `"onDoneTargetStateId"` argument.

Let's create a child state machine, the machine that is triggered when an administrator signs in to the system.

```csharp
// create the states for child state machine that must be executed
State checkingAdminAccessRights = new State("checkingAdminAccessRights")
.WithInvoke(async (callback) => {
    // checking rights
    bool hasAccess = await checkAccessAsync();
    await callback(hasAccess ? "ACCESS_GRANTED" : "ACCESS_DENIED");
})
.WithTransition("ACCESS_GRANTED", "unlockingDoorForAdmin")
.WithTransition("ACCESS_DENIED", "exit");

State unlockingDoorForAdmin = new State("unlockingDoorForAdmin")
.WithInvoke(async (cancel) => {
    // unlocking the door, once done, go to exit
    await unlockDoor();
}, "exit", null);

State exit = new State("exit")
// important! to make machine to exit, mark final state as final
// if you don't mark state as final, the state machine will never exits
.AsFinalState()
.WithInvoke(async (cancel) => {
    // notify some third party system about admin to sign in, exit
    await notifySystemAboutAdminSignIn();
    // as this state is a final state, no need to move to any other state
    // set both onDone and onError target state IDs as null
}, null, null);

// create state machine, providing ID, Name, Initia state ID and list of states.
StateMachine adminSignsInMachine = new StateMachine("adminSignsInMachine",
"Machine is executed on admin signs in", "checkingAdminAccessRights",
checkingAdminAccessRights, unlockingDoorForAdmin, exit);
```

Next step, create a root state machine to execute the previously defined `adminSignsInMachine`. Let's use the example from the chapter with callback service and extend it. Once admin requests the maintenance mode, the state machine moves to `"startingMaintenanceMode"`. In this state the previously composed state machine is executed as a service.

Once done, the state machine triggers another state, which is defined, in this case as the state with ID `"waitingForUser"`.

```csharp
// imagine we have a vending machine that awaits for
// user to come or an administrator to request a maintenance
State waitingForUser = new State("waitingForUser")
.WithInvoke(async (callback) => {
    // imagine we have an MQTT message to arrive when user signs in to a vending machine
    // we need to wait fot that
    mqttClient.Subscribe("user/unlockedDoor");
    // as well administrator can come and request maintenance mode
    // we wait for it in parallel
    mqttClient.Subscribe("adminUser/MaintenanceRequested");
    mqttClient.OnMessage((topic, message) => {
        switch(topic)
        {
            // based on the arrived message, we trigger event
            case "user/unlockedDoor":
                await callback("USER_UNLOCKED_DOOR");
                break;
            case "adminUser/MaintenanceRequested":
                await callback("ADMINISTRATOR_MAINTENANCE_ACCESS_REQUESTED");
                break;
        }
    });
}, () => { 
    // as we are leaving the state, to make sure those messages are
    // not arriving then we are not waiting for them, unsubscribe on cleanup code
    mqttClient.Unsubscribe("user/unlockedDoor");
    mqttClient.Unsubscribe("adminUser/MaintenanceRequested");
})
.WithTransition("USER_UNLOCKED_DOOR", "chekingUserBalance")
.WithTransition("ADMINISTRATOR_MAINTENANCE_ACCESS_REQUESTED", "startingMaintenanceMode");

// crete the state to trigger previously composed state machine as a service
State startingMaintenanceMode = new State("startingMaintenanceMode")
// once the state machine is done, start again the  "waitingForUser" state
// and throw exception in case of error (null argument indicates that go nowhere in case of error)
.WithInvoke(adminSignsInMachine, "waitingForUser", null);
```
