# Important

Work in progress! I will notify here once the version of the state machine engine can be used in production.

# XStateNet

.NET implementation of the finite state machine framework. Powerful and asynchronous framework to build and run finite state machines in .NET.


# Generate test coverage HTML

Open terminal in the project root directory. First, collect XPlat Code Coverage into XML file.

> To collect code coverage on any platform that is supported by .NET Core, install [Coverlet](https://github.com/coverlet-coverage/coverlet/blob/master/README.md) and use the --collect:"XPlat Code Coverage" option.

```sh
dotnet test --collect:"XPlat Code Coverage"
```

This will generate the XML file with cobertura format under `NetState.Tests` -> `TestResults` -> `<guid>` -> `coverage.cobertura.xml` file.

Second, if you don't have `reportgenerator` tool for dotnet, install it globally.

```sh
dotnet tool install -g dotnet-reportgenerator-globaltool
```

Then you can generate HTML files to browse the code coverage:

```sh
reportgenerator "-reports:NetState.Tests\TestResults\<guid>\coverage.cobertura.xml" "-targetdir:__HtmlCodeCoverageReport" -reporttypes:Html
```

> Note! replace `<guid>` with the GUID that was generated by the test coverage XML generator.

This will create the HTML report, which you can browse in your internet explorer.

Open `index.htm` or `index.html` in your browser.
